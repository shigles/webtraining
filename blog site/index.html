    <p>(Biff leaves the house and heads for the garage.) (v.o) Biff! Biff, where're you going now? I told you Grandma, I'm going to the dance! (We cut to the garage, where Marty is listening.) (v.o) When are you coming home?</p>
    <p>Ahh, thank ya. (Tannen stops just in front of Marty. He points his gun down at Marty meaning to finish him off. Suddenly Marty kicks the gun out of Tannen's hand. He stands up to face Tannen. Tannen throws a punch and nearly breaks his hand. Marty lifts his poncho to reveal the stove door that he put on as a bullet-proof vest. He saw the same thing in the Clint Eastwood movie that Biff was watching in the other 1985 time line. Marty takes off the stove door and slams it down on top of Tannen's head. He falls, but then stands up again. Marty punches him again and again, and Tannen crashes into the tombstone in front of a shop, breaking it in half, and then he lands headfirst in the A. Jones Manure Cart. Everyone stares.) (chuckles slightly.) That was good. (The Deputy Marshall and his officers are galloping on horseback toward the scene.) You know what I think? I think Buford's going to jail.</p>

    <p>Stop it. What? Does your mom know about tomorrow night? No, get out of town, my mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Well, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going up there with you. And I get this standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. Now look, I think she was born a nun. She's just trying to keep you respectable.</p>
    <p>Washing my hair. That's as funny as a screen door on a battleship. (Biffâ€™s Car) (under his breath) It's "screen door on a submarine," you dork. (Sidewalk)</p>
